# Codecademy_TeaShopProject

This ugly webpage is a  **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)** **Web Development Path** **[Project](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/getting-more-advanced-with-design/modules/layout-with-flexbox/projects/tea-cozy)**.

In this project, I recieved a reference of how a webpagge showl be formatted, and had to use what I learned about **css-flexbox**.

While I was working on this exercise, I also learned how to **locally install a package** containing a **pre-compressor tool**, so that I cand write my stylings as **.scss files**.
The advantages of this, such as using **__partials.scss_** and some of the Sass syntax to make my code more readable and mantainable, were still not used in this project, but will be experimented with in the future.
